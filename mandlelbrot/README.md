Mandelbrot
==========

An app that demonstrates how to send image content dynamically generated on a canvas as a picture.  The mandelbrot.html file contains the code that encodes and sends the image via Omlet.  The js files are the implementation of the Mandelbrot set generator.  This sample depends on Canvas support and Web Workers, so it may not work on older Android devices.
